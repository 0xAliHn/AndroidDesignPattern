//Model View Controller refers to the current reigning architectural pattern across several platforms; it’s particularly easy to set your project up in this way on Android. It refers to the three divisions of classes used in this pattern:

        Model: your data classes. If you have User or Product objects, these “model” the real world.

        View: your visual classes. Everything the user sees falls under this category.

        Controller: the glue between the two. It updates the view, takes user input, and makes changes to the model.

//Dividing your code between these three categories will go a long way toward making your code decoupled and reusable.
